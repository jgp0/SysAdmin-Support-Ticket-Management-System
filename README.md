This is a simple technical support ticket management system implemented in Python. It allows users to create tickets, add descriptions of the problem and list all stored tickets.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to use
1. Execute of main script:
   
```python
python engine/main.py
```

2. How works?

    Run the Python main script which will show you a simple menu indicating what you want to do; Create Ticket, List Ticket and Exit the program, use the options via the number.
   
    When creating a ticket you must enter the data indicated. When listing tickets it will show you all the tickets created with a unique numeric identifier.
